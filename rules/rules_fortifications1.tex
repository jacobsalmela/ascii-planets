Construction is one of the main ways for the \planet's inhabitants to expand into \outerspace.  \fortifications\ (buildings or ships) are constructed by connecting four dots on the map with lines to make a square. (A connection between two adjacent dots counts as one line.)
%TODO add example of drawing building/ship on the map
\newline\newline
The number of \fortifications\ you may draw on a turn is equal to the combined value of dice used for construction.  For example, the \academy\ and \factory\ each cost \texttt{8}; if you rolled a total of \texttt{16}, you could create two of either \fortifications\ or one of each.  You may use one or more \greatperson\ bonuses from the \population\ track (see \nameref{sec:population}, p.\pageref{sec:population} to increase the amount you have to spend by \texttt{4}).
