Since \asciiplanets\ is open source and written in LaTeX, you can download the 
source code and modify the game to your liking.
\newline\newline
One fun thing to do is to create your own planet.  You just need to modify a few
 values in the source code and then generate a new set of files.  Full 
 instructions can be found on the Wiki page:
