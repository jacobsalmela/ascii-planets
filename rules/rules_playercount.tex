Theoretically, any number of players can join a game of \asciiplanets.  For 
practical purposes, 1-7 players is recommended.  Some adjustments are made for 
1-2 player games.
\newline\newline
In a solo game,
\begin{itemize}
  \item You can still use \convoys\ and interact with \pirates.
  \item Once all \pirates\ camps are destroyed, you may build exactly one 
        \battleship\ to the \pirate's space following the normal rules (it does 
        not take space on your map; just mark it on the sheet).  Upon activating
        it, you may \activate\ any \armament\ as if you had two more of that 
        \armament.
  \item The game ends after 10 turns. Other triggers do not cause the game to 
        end (but you still get the \mastery\ bonuses).
\end{itemize}
In a two-player game,
\begin{itemize}
  \item The players do not have \reach\ to one another at the beginning of the 
        game (they are located on opposite sides of the galaxy). They may only 
        gain \reach\ through researching \warpdrive.
\end{itemize}
