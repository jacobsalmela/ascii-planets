In the \development\ phase, players use the dice to improve their \planets. Each die can be assigned to one of the following actions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \activating\ one building type
	\item For \trade\ (see \nameref{sec:trade}, p.\pageref{sec:trade})
	\item For \culture\ (see \nameref{sec:culture}, p.\pageref{sec:culture})
  \item Constructing \fortifications\ (see \nameref{sec:fortifications}, p.\pageref{sec:fortifications})
\end{itemize}
The following rules always apply:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The actions may be taken in any order
	\item Each action may be taken several times
	\item Each individual die may only be used once per player per turn
\end{itemize}
Playersâ€™ decisions are independent of one another. (Players may use the same dice for different purposes.)
\newline\newline
You may only use dice that are available to you based on your progress on the \tech\ track (see \nameref{sec:technology}, p.\pageref{sec:technology}).  At the beginning of the game, only \whitedice\ are available but the \bluedie\ and \blackdie\ are \textit{still rolled for the purpose of checking for Disasters}.  You can gain access to the other two dice once you develop enough \tech.
