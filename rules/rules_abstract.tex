      \noindent\asciiplanets\ is a board game in which 1-7 players lead an 
      entire planet through the modern age into a warp-capable civilization by 
      advancing \tech\ and \culture, training \population, constructing \
      \starships, and  interacting through \trade\ or inter-planetary conquest.
      \newline\newline
      Each planet's progress in various fields, production, and use of resources
      are marked on a piece of paper, the \textbf{Planet sheet}.  Each turn 
      begins with rolling of five dice.  During a brief round of \diplomacy, 
      some dice may be rerolled; the players then proceed to use the results to 
      mark their sheets.  When any of several possible game end conditions is 
      triggered, points are calculated and the player with the most points wins.
      \newline\newline
      The game is a \textit{standalone} roll-and-write game, based on mechanics
       from the original game, \textit{ASCII Empires}.  Both games are named for
        their use of text-based visuals inspired by the 1967 ASCII character 
        encoding standard.
