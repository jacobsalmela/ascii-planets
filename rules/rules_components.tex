Besides these rules, you will need:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One \planetsheet\ per player
	\item Pen(s) or pencil(s)
	\item 5 six-sided dice: 3 \whitedice\ 1 \bluedie, and 1 \blackdie\
\end{itemize}
The set referenced by the rulebook is listed above, but any colours will do as long as the players can tell them apart.
\newline\newline
The rules and \planetsheet\ of \asciiplanets\ can be downloaded online: the game is "print-and-play".
\newline\newline
The game is also open source and written in LaTeX, so you can contribute to the game's continued development at: \url{https://jacobsalmela.com/ascii-planets/}.  You can even create your own planets (see \nameref{sec:customizing}, p.\pageref{sec:customizing})!
