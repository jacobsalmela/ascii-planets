The end of the game is triggered as soon as any player has completely filled any\
of their tracks (\population, \currency, any branch of the \tech\ track, 
\military, \trade, \culture) or constructed each \level\ III \armament\  type - 
i.e. whenever a \masterysymbol\ symbol is checked.
\newline\newline
A player who foresees that they will end the game this way must announce it at 
the very beginning of that \development\ phase, and must then carry out this 
plan.  The only exception is when you trigger the end of the game by influencing
 an opponent's sheet (e.g. if you complete a \convoy\ that causes the final box 
 in their \culture\ grid to be checked).
\newline\newline
After the final \development\ phase and the ensuing \deployment\ phase, the 
points are calculated and the player with the most points wins. If several 
players are tied for most, follow the tiebreakers (see \nameref{sec:scoring}, 
p.\pageref{sec:scoring}).
