A happy \population\ provides points at the end of the game, but creeping \unhappiness\ may counter some of the gains and provoke \terrorism (see above).
\newline\newline
\happiness\ is gained through \trade\ (see \nameref{sec:trade}, p.\pageref{sec:trade}), \culture\ (see \nameref{sec:trade}, p.\pageref{sec:trade}) and \military\ victory over \pirates\ (see \nameref{sec:military}, p.\pageref{sec:military}). \unhappiness\ results from \disasters\, opponents' attacks on and Colonization of your \planet\ (see \nameref{sec:military}, p.\pageref{sec:military}), \conscription\ and \taxation\ (see \nameref{sec:anytime}, p.\pageref{sec:anytime}).
\newline\newline
Whenever you gain \happiness\ or \unhappiness, check the leftmost unchecked box of the corresponding track.  The leftmost still unchecked box shows your current score.  Neither \happiness\ nor \unhappiness\ may exceed the track.  In the end game scoring, \unhappiness\ is deducted from \happiness.  This may result in a negative score.
