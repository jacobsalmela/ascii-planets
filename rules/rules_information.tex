Players may inspect each otherâ€™s sheets at any time.  In the \development\ phase, even though players take most of their actions independently of one another, there are some instances where a player has to announce to others what they are doing:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Whenever they complete a \convoy\ (as this may provide benefits to others)
  \item Whenever they plan to trigger the end of the game. This must be announced at the very start of the \development\ phase; otherwise, such action may not be taken.
\end{itemize}
