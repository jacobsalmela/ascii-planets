\trade\ can make several \planets\ better off.  Acquiring exotic goods makes 
citizens happier but also allows other players to earn \currency.  \trade\ is 
not produced by a \armament.  Instead, die results may be allocated directly 
into one of the five \convoys\ of varying length.
\newline\newline
\convoys\ are completed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To check a box, you have to use a die with the specified number or 
        higher.
  \item The boxes of any given \convoy\ have to be checked in order from left to
        right.
  \item The rows can be completed in any order.
  \item You may have several unfinished \convoys\ travelling at once.
  \item You may check multiple boxes per turn if suitable dice are available.
\end{itemize}
When the \convoys' journey is finished (the last box of a row is checked), you 
must announce this to the other players.  You will then receive the reward 
indicated on its right: \happiness, \currency, and \tech\ or \culture.  
Moreover, each other player with \reach\ (see \nameref{sec:reach}, 
p.\pageref{sec:reach}) to your \planet\ earns the reward listed on the sheet.  
Checking all boxes of all \convoys\ triggers the end of the game and provides a 
scoring bonus.
