Staffing your \armament\ is accomplished by crossing off an \astronaut\ 
(\useastronautsymbol) from your \population\ track and then drawing the letter 
of the building in the box drawn on your \planetsheet.
\newline\newline
This is different then \activating\ a \armament, which gives you an adantage as 
described in \nameref{sec:armaments}, p.\pageref{sec:armaments}.

In short:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Staffing is done \textbf{once} and costs one \astronaut\    
        \useastronautsymbol.  You draw a letter in the box on your \planetsheet.
        It is possible this could be done on a different turn if you did not 
        have enough \astronauts\ to staff it at the time it was constructed.
  \item \activating\ can be done whenever you have a die to spend and the 
        \armament\ is already Staffed.  Activating allows you to use an 
        \armament's ability (see \nameref{sec:armaments}, 
        p.\pageref{sec:armaments})
\end{itemize}
