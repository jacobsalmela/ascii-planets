Staffing your \fortifications\ is accomplished by crossing off an \astronaut\ (\useastronautsymbol) from your \population\ track and then drawing the letter of the building in the box drawn on your \planetsheet.

This is different then \activating\ a \fortification, which gives you an adantage as described in \nameref{sec:fortifications}, p.\pageref{sec:fortifications}.

In short:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Staffing is done \textbf{once} and costs one \astronaut\ \useastronautsymbol.  You draw a letter in the box on your \planetsheet.  It's possible this could be done on a different turn if you did not have enough \astronauts\ to staff it at the time it was constructed.
  \item \activating\ can be done whenever you have enough die to spend and the \fortification is already Staffed.  Activating puts the \fortification\ to use to generate it's ability (see \nameref{sec:activating}, p.\pageref{sec:activating})
\end{itemize}
