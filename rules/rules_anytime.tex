If you find your accounts empty or enemy forces in orbit, you may gain one \unhappiness\ to immediately gain two \currency\ (\taxation) or train two \astronauts\ as \pilots\ to form a \squadron\ (\conscription).  No \factory\ or \starships\ are required for these actions.  \taxation\ and \conscription\ can be performed \textit{anytime} (including as reaction to an unfortunate dice roll or another player's declared attack against you) and can be repeated if you really need to.
