To leave your planet and venture into \outerspace, your \planet\ needs
\astronauts.  \astronauts\ are produced by an \academy\ and recorded on a 
player's \population\ track with slashes (\gainastronautsymbol).  You start with
three \astronauts.
\newline\newline
\astronauts\ are useful in several ways. They can:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Become a \specialist\ who staff \armaments\ and enable them to be 
        \activated\ (see \nameref{sec:armaments}, p.\pageref{sec:armaments})
	\item Be trained as \pilots\ when activating \starships\ (see 
        \nameref{sec:military}, p.\pageref{sec:military})
\end{itemize}
Whenever one group of boxes of the \population\ track is completely filled in 
(\gainastronautsymbol), a \greatperson\ emerges.  You may at any time check the
smaller box next to the group to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add \texttt{+4} to the value of one die when used for Construction
  \item Check 2 boxes of the \tech\ track.
  \item Check any 2 boxes of the \culture\ grid.
\end{itemize}
Filling the entire \population\ track triggers the end of the game and provides a scoring bonus.
