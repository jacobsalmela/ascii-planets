For the most part, the order in which players execute their actions does not 
matter.  Whenever it could (mostly in the \diplomacy\ or \deployment\ phases, 
although players may invoke this rule at any time), the players declare their 
actions in the order of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the most undeployed \squadrons\, or if tied,
  \item the most unspent \currency, followed by
  \item the most advanced single \tech\ track,
\end{itemize}
followed by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the highest \population.
\end{itemize}
The same logic is followed for tiebreakers in end game scoring
