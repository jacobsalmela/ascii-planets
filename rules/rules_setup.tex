Print a \planetsheet\ for each player.  A4 size is recommended.  If you plan to 
play several games, printing on both sides of the paper helps conserve trees.  
The sheets may be printed either in greyscale or in colour.
\newline\newline
Players should sit around a table facing each other. The tablespace in the 
middle is considered \outerspace.  In multiplayer games, the seating order 
dictates which \planets\ players can travel to once your first \starship\ is 
built and activated (see \nameref{sec:reach}, p.\pageref{sec:reach}).
\newline\newline
You may name your \planet\ and design a simple \insignia\ to represent yourself
(e.g. your initials or a small picture).  The \insignias\ are used for flavour 
but also to distinguish different players' \starships\ (see 
\nameref{sec:military}, p.\pageref{sec:military}).  You are then ready to start
playing!
