Special thanks (again) to @sum1els-com for feedback with this release:

- astronauts cost `$$` instead of `$` (#42) 
- corrected and adjusted scoring of astronauts: astronauts earn 1 point in the endgame, currency scores 2 (#42)
- disallow armament touching, forcing the player to expand their real estate footprint and make harder choices (#43)
- more mountains added because of the above (#43)
- incentivize building on mountains and nebulas for +1 defense (#43)
- add space junk for thematics and as a road block to expanding into space (#43)
- armaments must be built and staffed on a single turn (#41)
- improved readability of planet in the codebase by putting each coordinate on one line.  this makes it easier to change the planet's configuration and to see what coordinate has what resource
